 **WELL , I have a long story and so many reasons to do that .
 Exacltly a year ago I arrived at JFK international airport in New York , and it was like a fresh start , new life for me. Being a dentist in Ukraine , was all what I have in my life , when I arrived here I found that little voice inside me telling me to do the thing you liked all your life ( becoming a game developer ) . To be a game developer I should learn how to code , so Me and my beautiful wife decided that I should do the thing I wanted to do all my life . It's was hard to make this first step , but my family and my wife encourage me to do that . first it was hard to decide where should I start or when , but then my good friend told me about the Flotiron school . I found the right place to start my new career . I will enjoy all the 10 months with Flatiron school and with all the amazing people I met here . Someday I hope , I will code my own game in Hideo Kojima style.  **
 
 
**Everything is happens , it's happens for a good reasons .**

**I think that being a software enginer , that will make life better , and I will able to make this world a little bit better**
